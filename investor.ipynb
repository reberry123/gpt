      "Summary: A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a \"homunculus computer\"—a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\n",
      "In the United States, the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act forces internet providers to provide backdoors for government authorities.  In 2024, the U.S. government realized that China had been tapping communications in the U.S. using that infrastructure for months, or perhaps longer; China recorded presidential candidate campaign office phone calls —including employees of the then-vice president of the nation– and of the candidates themselves.\n",
      "A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\n",
      "Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n",
      "Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.\u001b[0m\n",

CVE-2024-3094 is a critical supply chain vulnerability discovered in the XZ Utils compression library, specifically affecting versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. This vulnerability involves a malicious backdoor embedded in the upstream tarballs of the xz package. The backdoor was obfuscated within the build process of liblzma, a core component of XZ Utils, and could be triggered ... The CVE-2024-3094 backdoor serves as a stark reminder that security diligence is paramount, even in the seemingly innocuous world of compression utilities. As a community, we must remain ... The CVE-2024-3094 vulnerability was embedded through sophisticated multi-stage obfuscation and encryption techniques, making detection particularly challenging. The backdoor was designed to execute malicious payloads discreetly, exploiting the trust in the XZ Utils' widespread adoption across various Linux distributions. What is CVE-2024-3094? Recently, a critical security problem, known as CVE-2024-3094, was found in the XZ Utils library.

While not widely deployed to production systems at the time of discovery (March 29, 2024), it was present in development versions of major distributions.  The backdoor was sophisticated, using multi-stage obfuscation and encryption, and highlighted the importance of supply chain security, even in seemingly innocuous software like compression utilities.
